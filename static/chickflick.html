She was blind but didn't matter.<br/>
He was ugly as fuck.<br/><br/>

He reeked like a corpse dead for fourty two days covered with garbage and farts.<br/>
But didn't matter because she had lost her sense of smell in a chemical accident when she was four.<br/>
That same accident might have costed her her eyesight as well.<br/>
Others say she was born blind.<br/><br/>

Anywho, he was rich and that is a fact.<br/>
But that didn't matter because she never loved money, just people.<br/>
And the occasional scotch.<br/><br/>

About his wealth many stories have been told.<br/>
But that didn't matter because she couldn't hear anything.<br/>
No fortunatelly she was not deaf.<br/>
Her sound perception was so strong that she had to walk around with headphones all the time so not to go crazy.<br/>
She only listened to Bach. Her grandmother cultivated her love for him.<br/><br/>

He would have loved her greatly.<br/>
She would have given him her heart.<br/>
But that didn't matter because they never met, actually.<br/>
