The bird sat on the branch.<br/>
After a month he could not make rent so he had to fly out.<br/><br/>

The dog stopped to pee on the telephone pole.<br/>
He got a fine so big that he had to work an extra shift and broke up with his lover.<br/><br/>

The snake tried to bite the little girl.<br/>
But his left tooth was hurting for a week now but had no money to go check it up so he gave it another thought.<br/><br/>

The bee was flying around on a warm Monday morning.<br/>
But ran out of gas and did not fly again until she got a job.<br/><br/>

The shark swam to the coast.<br/>
But then he felt terror because he realized he couldn't find his way home since his GPS was stolen and he could not afford a new one.<br/><br/>

Jade was nervous because she wouldn't probably be able to pay her daughter's tuition this month.<br/>
For an instant she thought how happy she would be if she was an animal and did not have to think about money.<br/><br/>

Maybe in your next life Jade!
