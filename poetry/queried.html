"John!", she screamed in the middle of the street.<br/>
"Stacy?", he asked.<br/><br/>

"Can you remember the last time you saw a tucan bird dressed in a half black half red handkit sweater?", he asked.<br/><br/>

"Are you gonna vote?", she asked mildy buffled.<br/>
"Are you gonna dance naked in the middle of the street on a mildly cold Thursday evening?", he asked.<br/><br/>

"Am I really doing that?", he asked.<br/><br/>

"Yes John!", she proclaimed with apparent anger.<br/>
"Is is really that annoying?", he asked.<br/><br/>

"Fuck off John...", she said with a tone of despair.<br/>
"Would you like fries with that?", he asked.<br/>
