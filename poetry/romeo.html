<font face="Arial Black"><center> 

In the sky I wrote her name.<br/>
Then I wrote mine.<br/>
I compared.<br/>
I liked mine better.<br/>
We broke up.<br/><br/>

Playing with the sea water she asked me to write 'I love you' on the sand.<br/>
I said no.<br/>
She did not like the idea.<br/>
'Look a starfish', I said.<br/>
She flipped me off.<br/><br/>

She saw some flowers she liked and she asked me to cut one for her.<br/>
I said I would be damned for eternity if I did it because some bee could have used that flower one day.<br/>
We did not have sex that night.<br/><br/>

I had some scrap paper lying on my desk.<br/>
She gave me one blank sheet and told me to write a poem for her.<br/>
I sighed and wrote exacltly eleven words on it.<br/>
She said 'is this a poem?'<br/>
I said, 'It's symbolic and if you don't get it go fuck yourself'.<br/></center></font>
