It took me 1 year to get to that place,<br/>
and another 2 years to return.<br/><br/>

It took another 3 years to realize I had to go back<br/>
and by the time I was finished 4 years had passed.<br/><br/>

5 years later nothing was as hard as it was at first,<br/>
but it was only by year 6 that I remembered I was telling this story to my dog<br/>
and had to multiply everything by 7 years.<br/>
